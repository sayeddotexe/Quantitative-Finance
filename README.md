# Quantitative-Finance
Demonstration the use of mathematical models and extremely large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities.

# Goals
* Demonstrate the use of Modeling for Quantiative Finance.
* Succesfully use Black-Scholes, Binomial trees and Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate various financial properties.
* Understand how American and European options affect price.
* Create a visualisation for these models.

# Python libraries Used
* NumPy - To create multi-dimensional arrays, matrices etc. for Machine learning models.
* Matplotlib - For data visualisation and graphical plotting of data.
* Math - Functions that are useful in number theory and representation theory.
* Ta-Lib -  Used in analyzing the stock market's historical data like share price, volume, etc.
